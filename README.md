The **Article Preview Component** is a minimal and modern UI element that displays an article summary along with author details and interactive share options.  
This component is perfect for **blogs, news portals, magazine websites, or UI practice projects** where users want to show article teasers in an elegant and compact way.

The design focuses on clarity, readability, and smooth interactions. By clicking the share icon, users can reveal a sleek popup containing social media sharing options — a valuable UI pattern commonly used in modern content-based websites.
